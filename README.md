# POSIX Lexing with Bitcoded Regular Expressions

Run the code with

```isabelle build -c -v -d . Posix```

Tested with Isabelle2022.


* RegLangs.thy (contains basic definitions for Regular Languages)

* PosixSpec.thy (contains values and POSIX definitions)

* Lexer.thy (first algorithm by Sulzmann & Lu without simplification)

* LexerSimp.thy (correctness for simple-minded simplification rules)

* Blexer.thy (second algorithm by Sulzmann & Lu without simplification)

* BlexerSimp.thy (correctness for aggressive simplification rules)

* Finite Bound Result:
  	 BasicIdentidies.thy
	 ClosedForms.thy
	 GeneralRegexBound
	 ClosedFormBounds.thy
	 FBound.thy (formalises all results from Section 5 in the paper)
